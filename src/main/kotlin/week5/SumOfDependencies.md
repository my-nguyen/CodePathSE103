Given a directed and connected graph with n nodes. If there is an edge from u to v then u depends on v. Our task was
to find out the sum of dependencies for every node.

####Example:
For the graph in diagram,  
A depends on C and D i.e. 2  
B depends on C i.e. 1  
D depends on C i.e. 1  
And C depends on none.  
Hence answer -> 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
